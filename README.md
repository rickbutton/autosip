# WARNING

This is expressly against the Grinding Gear Games Terms of Service and could very well get you banned.

Many people use flask scripts in order to alleviate wrist/finger pain associated with playing PoE. GGG does not provide an exception for those who cannot piano roll 1-5 for many hours a day without pain. Use your best judgement and don't blame me if you get banned.
